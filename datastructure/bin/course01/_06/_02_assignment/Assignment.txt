1. Write an add method, which takes two positive integers and returns their sum. Of course, 
	for this problem, you need to use recursion. Think about what would be the base case 
	(when a number becomes 0?).
	
2. Write a recursive method to calculate the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. 
	n is to be given as an input.
	
3. What is the time complexity of the 'Tower of Hanoi' problem? Modify the program to 
	track the number of moves (every time a disc is moved from one tower to another) and 
	print it when the program completes execution.
	See how it changes when you change the number of discs to be moved. 
	Does that give you an idea of time complexity?
