1. Write a method in your BinarySearchTree class which counts 
	the number of leaf nodes present in this tree.
	
2. Implement a recursive algorithm to find the height of a binary search tree.

3. Given a sorted array in increasing order of elements, write an algorithm to create a 
	binary search tree with least height. Before implementing, think about the strategy you will adopt.
