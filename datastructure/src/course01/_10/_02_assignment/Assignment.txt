1. Create a new HashTable class. Implement the hash table data structure using open 
	addressing (quadratic probing). Think about, why do we need to override the hashcode 
	method in java, in case one wants to use custom objects to be used as keys to a hash table. 
	You can call the hashcode method to get the int rep of the object, and then call 
	the hash function on that integer. After completing the above exercise, put some records 
	in your hash table and see (using a debugger), how the underlying array data structure looks like.
